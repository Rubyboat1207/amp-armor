        The extinguishing agent is a minimal-impact foaming agent that, when mixed
        with water, creates an expanding barrier between the battery and the car
        around it. This foam is stored in a strong, pressurized metal canister. Like
        a fire extinguisher, meant to be resilient against the years.
        <br/>
        The activation system doesn&#39;t require any driver input, and instead relies
        on heat emitted by the fire. It uses a thermomechanical switch, meaning when
        heat is applied, the material in the switch begins to change shape and contact
        the other side of the circuit. It connects the circuit, and then powers a
        motor which uncorks the canister and lets the extinguishing agent flow out.
        <br/>
        In the event this system fails, the cap itself is made of a metal made to
        melt a certain temperature to release the extinguishing agent.`;return{c(){e=g("div"),e.innerHTML=a,this.h()},l(t){e=$(t,"DIV",{slot:!0,class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),T(e)!=="svelte-7i1xwe"&&(e.innerHTML=a),this.h()},h(){c(e,"slot","p"),c(e,"class","text-white text-xl w-full")},m(t,s){x(t,e,s)},p:H,d(t){t&&l(e)}}}function R(h){let e,a="How does it work?";return{c(){e=g("div"),e.textContent=a,this.h()},l(t){e=$(t,"DIV",{slot:!0,class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),T(e)!=="svelte-810k2r"&&(e.textContent=a),this.h()},h(){c(e,"slot","title"),c(e,"class","text-red-500")},m(t,s){x(t,e,s)},p:H,d(t){t&&l(e)}}}function U(h){let e,a=`The chemical in the fire extinguisher is an expanding foam meant to put
        out Class A and B fuel fires. The class simply means what an
        extinguisher is meant to put out. The fire extinguishers you have at
        home, for example, are Class ABC. Class A fires are fires on things like
        wood, paper, or cloth. Class B fires involve liquids, like gasoline or
        the electrolyte in batteries.
        <br/>
        Another important step to understanding how fires work is the fire triangle.

        If a runaway reaction has already begun, we donâ€™t expect the extinguisher
        to be enough to fully stop the runaway reaction. However, by cooling the
        battery and cutting off oxygen, it significantly reduces the reaction rate
        and increases the time it takes for the battery to ignite, buying valuable
        time for the driver.`;return{c(){e=g("div"),e.innerHTML=a,this.h()},l(t){e=$(t,"DIV",{slot:!0,class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),T(e)!=="svelte-oplv5z"&&(e.innerHTML=a),this.h()},h(){c(e,"slot","p"),c(e,"class","text-white text-xl w-full")},m(t,s){x(t,e,s)},p:H,d(t){t&&l(e)}}}function W(h){let e,a,t,s,r,d,u,o,n,m;return t=new Y({props:{name:"heroVisual",$$slots:{default:[G]},$$scope:{ctx:h}}}),u=new A({props:{$$slots:{p:[Q],title:[J]},$$scope:{ctx:h}}}),n=new A({props:{color:"bg-red-500",$$slots:{p:[U],title:[R]},$$scope:{ctx:h}}}),{c(){e=g("div"),a=g("div"),w(t.$$.fragment),s=k(),r=g("div"),d=k(),w(u.$$.fragment),o=k(),w(n.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(i){e=$(i,"DIV",{class:!0});var f=E(e);a=$(f,"DIV",{class:!0});var p=E(a);y(t.$$.fragment,p),s=I(p),r=$(p,"DIV",{class:!0}),E(r).forEach(l),d=I(p),y(u.$$.fragment,p),o=I(p),y(n.$$.fragment,p),p.forEach(l),f.forEach(l),this.h()},h(){c(r,"class","mb-24"),c(a,"class","w-11/12"),c(e,"class","w-full flex justify-center")},m(i,f){x(i,e,f),v(e,a),_(t,a,null),v(a,s),v(a,r),v(a,d),_(u,a,null),v(a,o),_(n,a,null),m=!0},p(i,[f]){const p={};f&1&&(p.$$scope={dirty:f,ctx:i}),t.$set(p);const S={};f&1&&(S.$$scope={dirty:f,ctx:i}),u.$set(S);const D={};f&1&&(D.$$scope={dirty:f,ctx:i}),n.$set(D)},i(i){m||(b(t.$$.fragment,i),b(u.$$.fragment,i),b(n.$$.fragment,i),m=!0)},o(i){C(t.$$.fragment,i),C(u.$$.fragment,i),C(n.$$.fragment,i),m=!1},d(i){i&&l(e),V(t),V(u),V(n)}}}class re extends j{constructor(e){super(),F(this,e,null,W,P,{})}}export{re as component};
