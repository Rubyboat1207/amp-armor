              his car shaking. Thinking it was a flat tire he then pulled to the
              side of the highway. After pulling over to inspect what was wrong,
              he noticed a thick white smoke coming from the underside of his
              vehicle. At that very moment, his car burst into a violent
              inferno. He immediately called 911, but by the time first
              responders arrived at the scene, the car was completely engulfed
              in flames. In an interview following the incident, he remarked
