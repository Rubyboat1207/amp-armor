    For our solution, we will be using a chemical fire extinguisher. Chemicals
    are regulated by the EPA. We will use an approved chemical non-fluorinated
    aqueous expanding foam fire extinguisher. EPA regulations related to fire
    extinguishing agents primarily focus on environmental considerations, such
    as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. These regulations aim to minimize
    the impact of firefighting chemicals on air and water quality. NFPA 10:
    Standard for Portable Fire Extinguishers: This standard provides
    comprehensive guidance on the selection, installation, maintenance, and use
    of portable fire extinguishers. It covers various types of fire
    extinguishing agents, including aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF), which is
    similar to non-fluorinated aqueous expanding foam. Underwriters Laboratories
    (UL): UL is a global safety certification company that conducts testing and
    certification of various products, including fire protection equipment and
    systems. Fire extinguishers, fire alarms, sprinklers, and other fire safety
    products may undergo UL testing and certification to ensure compliance with
    safety standards. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): FEMA is an
    agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security responsible for
    coordinating disaster response, recovery, and preparedness efforts. FEMA
    provides resources and guidance related to fire safety and emergency
    management. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA): The
    NHTSA, a part of DOT, is responsible for setting and enforcing vehicle
    safety standards. This includes regulations related to crashworthiness,
    occupant protection, and vehicle performance. For electric vehicles, NHTSA
    establishes safety standards specific to EV components such as batteries,
    electric drivetrains, and charging systems. DOT, through agencies like
    NHTSA, provides educational resources and outreach initiatives to raise
    awareness about electric vehicle safety among consumers, vehicle
    manufacturers, and first responders. These efforts may include safety
    guidelines for charging infrastructure, information about EV-specific safety
    features, and training programs for emergency responders on handling
    electric vehicle accidents.

  <p slot="p" class="text-white lg:text-lg">
    In order to mitigate battery fires, we will create an expanding foam fire
    extinguisher that envelopes the battery, starving it of oxygen. This
    provides more time for people to evacuate the vehicle and first responders
    to properly extinguish the battery out before it destroys the vehicle. In
    vehicles coming from the factory, this device can be installed as a new
    safety feature. It can be advertised as a safety feature to prevent property
    damage in vehicle collisions, and other faults that would affect the
    battery. The device is a system of a foam extinguishing agent to coat the
    battery compartment in an electric vehicle. The device is a standalone unit,
    and has its own backup battery that will keep the safety feature active even
    in a blackout situation. This device will also be able to be retro-fitted to
    older electric vehicles that didn't have the option to have the device
    equipped from the factory.
